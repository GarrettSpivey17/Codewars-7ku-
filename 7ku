  def band_name_generator(name: str) -> str:
      name = name.lower()
      if name[0] == name[-1]:
          return name.title() + name[1:]
      else:
        return "The " + name.title()
  the second line makes sure that any input will become lowercase, next i used an if else
  statement, so if the name has the same first and last letter it adds the name with the name minus the first letter while also capitalizing the first letter.  
  If the name does not include the same first and last letter the else statment returns the name with "the" before the name and still capitalizes it.
